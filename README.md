## Overview
Groupie Trackers pulls data from an API containing:
- **Artists**: Band and artist details including name, image, start year, first album date, and members.
- **Locations**: Concert locations.
- **Dates**: Concert dates.
- **Relation**: Links between artists, locations, and dates.

The project displays this data using various visualizations and allows interaction through client-server communication.

## Features
- **Artist Information**: Display artist profiles with images, names, and details.
- **Concert Information**: Show upcoming and past concerts, including locations and dates.
- **Data Visualization**: Use graphs and charts to visualize concert frequencies, timelines, and other relevant data.
- **Client-Server Interaction**: Features to search and filter concert data based on user input.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/antmusumba/groupie-tracker
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd groupie-trackers
   
   ```

## Usage

### API Integration

Fetch data from the provided API endpoints to populate the website:

```javascript
// Example of fetching artist data
fetch('API_URL/artists')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Handle the artist data
    });
```

### Website Design

Design the website to display:
- **Home Page**: Artist profiles using cards or blocks.
- **Concert Info Page**: Tables or lists showing concert locations and dates.
- **Data Visualizations**: Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to create graphs and timelines.

### Client-Server Interaction

Implement features that trigger events and communicate with the server. For example, a search feature for concerts:

```javascript
document.querySelector('#searchBtn').addEventListener('click', async () => {
    const artistName = document.querySelector('#artistInput').value;
    const response = await fetch(`API_URL/search?artist=${artistName}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    displayConcerts(data);
});
```
